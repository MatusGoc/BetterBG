### A alternative to [usrbg by Discord-Custom-Covers](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg)
To install it in your theme, put this in:
```
@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloneyInnit/BetterBG/master/bg/backgrounds.css');
```
To install it as a Powercord theme, just do:
```
cd <Your Powercord Directory>\src\Powercord\themes
```
and then:
```
git clone https://github.com/CloneyInnit/BetterBG/
```

### Additional info:
**BetterBG** supports usrbg backgrounds, but they are *disabled by default.* <br/>
You can enable them, by replacing
```
/*@import url('https://discord-custom-covers.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');*/
```
with
```
@import url('https://discord-custom-covers.github.io/usrbg/dist/usrbg.css');
```
in the `BetterBG.theme.css` file.
